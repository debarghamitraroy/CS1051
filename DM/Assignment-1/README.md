# [Assignment-1: Celebrity Identification Problem][def1]

In a party of $n$ people, a celebrity is defined as someone who:

- Doesn't know anyone at the party and
- Everyone else at the party knows the celebrity

Your task is to find the celebrity in the party (if one exists).

- Write a program in python to accomplish that task.
- Use a helper function `knows(A, B)` which returns true if person A knows person B, and false otherwise.
- Assume that the relationships among participants can be represented by a digraph $G(V, E)$ where there is a vertex for each of the $n$ participants and an edge from $u$ to $v$ if $u$ knows $v$.
