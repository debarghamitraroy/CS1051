# [Assignment-3][def1]

Write a program that solves the problem described below.

Given an array consisting of integers where a particular value (let's denote it by $r$) appears multiple times, you need to sort the array such that:

- All integers less than $r$ appear first.
- All $r$ appear next.
- All integers greater than $r$ appear last.

For example:

**Input:** $[5, 2, -1, 0, 3, 0, -7, 0, 8, -2]$

**Output:** $[-1, -7, -2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 2, 3, 8]$
