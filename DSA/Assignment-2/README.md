# [Assignment-2: Hierholzer's Algorithm][def1]

Write a python program that takes an undirected graph as input add

- Checks whether the graph is Eulerian or not.
- If found Eulerian, then your program should compute and print a Euler tour in the graph using Hierholzer's Algorithm.
- Your program should also print the cycles as they are discovered and merged (spliced) with the existing cycle during the execution of the algorithm.

You may use adjacency list or adjacency matrix as the data structure to store the input graph.
